# 2D-Air-Water-Couette-Flow-CFD-Simulation-Python-NumPy-
This project simulates steady, laminar airflow over a flat water surface using the 2D incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations with an energy equation. It models an air layer sheared by a moving top lid and heated from above. The simulation computes velocity, pressure, and temperature fields using a finite-difference projection method.
